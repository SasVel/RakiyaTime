# RakiyaTime

This is a little joke app based on the Bulgarian saying "Every time is rakiya time!". Don't use while driving.
The application gets the UTC 0 time and calculates in which time zone is between 4 PM and 5 PM at the moment.
Then displays a list of 3 randomized places from a ready-made dictionary that are in said time zone.
Happy drinking and use responsibly!
